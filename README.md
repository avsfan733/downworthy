Ruckus Extension
==========
This is a very fork of the uber popular plugin/extension/adin Downworthy that is intended as social satire and commentary [1] of The sleepiest Associate Supreme Court Justice [2]. Justice Thomas was nominated to the court by President George H. W. Bush, the metaphorical child of President Ronald Reagan, the keeper of white heaven. Think about that.

The plugin replaces text references to Justice Thomas with varying references to 'Uncle Ruckus' a character from the Boondocks, a popular comic and animated show. Uncle Ruckus [3], the character not the Associate Justice, is notable for being a person with black skin who holds virulent white supremacist points of view. The character is generally accepted as a critique of systematic racism, internalized normative narratives that manifest as self-hate, and as a metaphor for those from older generations who cling to absurdly prejudiced characterizations of minority groups.

I, no relation, am far from the first to make the association between Thomas and Ruckus [4]. But I think I am the first to make a chrome plugin as social commentary on a Supreme Court Justice. Maybe? Either way, let's have some fun with it.
